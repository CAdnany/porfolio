[File Permissions in Linux](https://tinyurl.com/bdfna5t7)

Project description: The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure.

[Python](https://tinyurl.com/3e2au934)

Project description: Update a file through Python algorithm. I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access.

[Apply Filters to SQL Queries](https://tinyurl.com/29pyax4j)

Project description: My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.
